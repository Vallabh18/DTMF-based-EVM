# DTMF-based-EVM
My cell phone based voting machine consists of microcontroller Arduino R3 uno, a DTMF decoder MT8870D, a memory storage device EEPROM and an LCD 16*2 Matrix dispplay. DTMF is sent to the microcontroller which is decoded by MT8870D. You can also setup the password to authenticate candidate's number. 
This project is based on arduino language programming. The software platform used in this project is arduino IDE.
